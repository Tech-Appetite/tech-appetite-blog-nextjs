## Planning the Upgrade
I decided to split up the upgrade work into two separate Epic buckets, Higher-Level Environment Work and Solution Upgrade Work. Tasks below that have a direct link on them will be discussed in this post.

### Higher-Level Environment Work included the following tasks:
- Configure ARM template for Sitecore 10.4 XM Topology
- Configure Friendly URLs & Certs
- Upgrade Existing v9.3 Databases & Clean Up Content Databases
- [Migrate Media Items from SQL to Azure Blob Storage](#migrate-media-items-from-sql-to-azure-blob-storage)
- Upgrade SXA Content
- CI/CD Build Pipeline
- CI/CD Release Pipeline
- Blue-Green Deplyoment

### Solution Upgrade Work included the following tasks:
- Review Sitecore Upgrade Documentation
- Track v10.4 README
- Local Docker Installation
- Upgrade SXA Theming
- Serialization
- Tooling
- Package References
- Sitecore Hotfixes
- Compare Sitecore showconfig.aspx
- Build and Deploy Upgraded Local Solution
- Testing: Workflow
- Testing: Asset Configuration
- Testing: Accessibility
- Testing: RTE Customizations and CMS Buttons
- Testing: Scriban Processors
- Testing: SXA Theme
- Upgrade-Related Support Tickets

## Migrate Media Items from SQL to Azure Blob Storage
Sitecore provides a migration tool (PowerShell scripts) for this step. The tool will copy all media items from the SQL database to Azure Blob Storage. The tool will also update the media item URLs in the Sitecore database to point to the new Azure Blob Storage URLs using the `blob://` format.

Since there were over 500k media items, we decided to run the migration scripts on two separate VM boxes to speed up the process. The second VM was set up so that the SQL query was put in DESC order. The migration still took about 3 days to complete for master *and* web databases, but realistically it could have been done in less than 2 days if you don't run the web database, and instead just delete the blobs from SQL directly and only run the blob format SQL query directly in SSMS for web.

The script does a good job of tracking transaction count to determine when you've reached the halfway point, but you can also check the Azure Blob Storage container in Azure Portal to see the progress of the migration:

- `GetBlobProperties` API transaction is a good indicator for whether a blob already exists or not. 
- `PutBlob` API transaction would be a blob write operation, such as writing the blob from Sitecore to storage.

> Tip: If you're migrating blobs for multiple environments, you can use [AzCopy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-blobs-copy) to copy blobs from one container to another. This can drastically decrease the time it takes to migrate blobs, since the script first checks if the blob already exists, especially if half of the Blobs were already existing from a lower  environment (e.g., Test to Prod).

### SQL Queries To Check Blob Migration Status
SQL Queries can also be helpful to check the status of media items throughout the migration process. Here are a few examples:

**Get Media Item Blob Field Value by Media Item Name**
```sql
-- Find a single media item's media field value by item name
SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Items] i
	LEFT JOIN
(
    SELECT [ItemId], [Value]
    FROM dbo.SharedFields 
    WHERE [Value] != '' AND (FieldId='{40E50ED9-BA07-4702-992E-A912738D32DC}' OR FieldId='{DBBE7D99-1388-4357-BB34-AD71EDF18ED3}')
) sf
ON i.[ID] = sf.[ItemId]
where i.[Name] = 'gratisography-funflower-800x525'
```

**Get Counts of Blob Field Values from SharedFields, VersionedFields, UnversionedFields, and ArchivedFields Types**
```sql
--SQL QUERIES FOR BLOB VALUE COUNTS COMPARED AGAINST AZURE BLOB (BLOB://) VALUE COUNTS

--SELECT * FROM dbo.SharedFields With (NOLOCK)
SELECT COUNT(1) AS 'Value','NonBlobValueTotalSharedFields' as Title FROM dbo.SharedFields With (NOLOCK)
WHERE FieldId IN (
('{40E50ED9-BA07-4702-992E-A912738D32DC}'),
('{DBBE7D99-1388-4357-BB34-AD71EDF18ED3}')) 
	AND (TRY_CONVERT(UNIQUEIDENTIFIER, [Value]) IS NOT NULL) AND VALUE NOT LIKE 'blob%'
--UNION ALL

SELECT COUNT(1) AS 'Value', 'BlobValueTotalSharedFields' as Title FROM dbo.SharedFields With (NOLOCK)

## Upgrade SXA Theming
Our project contained signficant customizations to the SXA Theme JavaScript files, including BaseTheme and Components Theme. Since we serialized these changes, it was easy to see a higher-level view of file changes:

![Sitecore SXA Base Theme Serialized with TDS](/static/images/blog-content-images/2024-11-12_104-upgrade-sxa-base-themes-tds.png)

The only way to resolve the differences and get the latest from Sitecore is by downloading a vanilla copy of the 10.4 SXA Themes from the media library and doing a file comparison between your version and the newer version. I decided to compare and move our 9.3 changes into the newer 10.4 version.

In the BaseTheme, we had unused typeahead functionality in the SXA `SearchBoxModel`, and Sitecore replaced typeahead with autocomplete. We were seeing console errors on some SXA search pages regarding *autoComplete is not defined*.
